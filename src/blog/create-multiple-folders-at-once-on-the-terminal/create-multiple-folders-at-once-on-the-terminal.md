I think you are familiar with the problem. You start a new project and to make the structure you should do something like this:

```shell
mkdir new-project && cd new-project
mkdir src && cd src

// Create folders
mkdir components
mkdir assets
mkdir configs
mkdir locales
// ...
// WHAT THE HELL?
```

This is so frustrating! There should be a better solution ðŸ¤”

You can use this syntax to create multiple folders in a directory at once. Plain and simple:

```shell
mkdir -p new-project/src/{components,assets,configs,locales}
```

ðŸ˜² Just that?
Yes, just that. But let's review what happened here:
- You use `-p` to create sub-directories and on each level, if it doesn't exist, it makes sure that it will be.

- Then with `{}` you pass a comma-separated list of names to create multiple directories beside each other.

Wasn't that bad, hah?
